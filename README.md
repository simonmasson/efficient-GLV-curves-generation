# Efficient GLV curves generation
Generation of efficient four-dimensional GLV curves with high security (256-bit)

Included :<br>
 - <b>tables_1_2_Smith.sage</b><br> 
 Computes the possible j-invariants for a fixed discriminant $D_0\cdit f^2$ for which a CM Hasegawa $\mathbb Q$-curve arises.
 
 - <b>thm_6_Smith.sage</b><br>
 Computes $(s,\Delta)$ for which $E_{d,s,\Delta}$ is a $\mathbb Q$-curve for which the four-dimensional GLV method is possible.
 
 - <b>generating_primes.sage</b><br> 
 Computes a list of primes with efficient finite field arithmetic, and stores it in a file 'primes.sage'.
 
 - <b>generating_curves.sage</b><br>
 Computes a list of curves with efficient arithmetic, for which we can apply the four-dimensional GLV method. The list is stored in
 'GLV4_curves.txt'.
