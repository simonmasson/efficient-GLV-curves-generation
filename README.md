4 files :
 
 - <b>tables_1_2_Smith.sage</b><br> 
 Computes the tables 1 and 2 from Smith article.
 
 - <b>thm_6_Smith.sage</b><br>
 Computes theorem 6 from Smith article.
 
 - <b>generating_primes.sage</b><br> 
 Computes a list of primes with efficient finite field arithmetic, and stores it in a file primes.sage.
 
 - <b>generating_curves.sage</b><br>
 Computes a list of curves with efficient arithmetic, for which we can apply the four-dimensional GLV method. The list is stored in
